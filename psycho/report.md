**Session Notes - 2025**

* **Anxiety**: Been experiencing frequent anxiety attacks, especially during morning commutes or when faced with unexpected situations. Feel like I'm constantly "on edge," even in mundane tasks.
* **Perfectionism**: Struggle to complete tasks efficiently due to an overwhelming need for perfection. This leads to procrastination and missed deadlines. Feeling stuck in a cycle of self-criticism.
* **Postponement**: Tendency to put off important decisions or conversations, fearing they might lead to conflict or disappointment.

* **Emotional Reactions**:
	+ Felt overwhelmed during a meeting at work when a colleague suggested an alternative approach. I hesitated and agreed, but felt like I compromised my values.

* **Situations**:
	+ Avoided calling a friend back because I didn't want to discuss our previous disagreement.

* **Self-Reflection**: Realized that my perfectionism is closely tied to fear of failure and criticism from others. This understanding has led me to question whether I'm seeking external validation or genuine self-improvement.
* **Growth**: Took a small step by speaking up in a group setting at work, even though it made me uncomfortable.
